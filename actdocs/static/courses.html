                <li>Dave is the author of "Data Munging with Perl" (Manning, 2001) and a co-author of
                    "Perl Template Toolkit" (O'Reilly, 2003). He is a regular speaker at

                    <li>We'll look at how you create the classes you need to use DBIx::Class with a database,
