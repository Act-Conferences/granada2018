    <h2>Sponsorship Proposal</h2>
    
    <p>
    One of the key principles behind YAPC conferences is the minimal price for the attendees. The role of sponsors is so important because YAPCs are not commercial events. To make a grassroots conference like YAPC::Europe happen, we need money. If you want to give something back to the Perl community and support us, we would be happy to welcome you as a sponsor.
