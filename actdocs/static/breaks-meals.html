    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
       Lunch is organized as a <em>tapas crawl</em>, since Granada is well-known for the ancient tradition of complementing your drink (in bars and cafes) with a small (and sometimes not so small) amount of food (the <em>tapa</em>). We have reached an agreement with several bars sorrounding the Conference venue that will accept <em>Coinions</em> (the "official" Conference's coin) as the way to pay for your drink and its associated tapa. These bars will be well marked and menus will be in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, when registering yourself at the Conference's registration desk, you will get <s></u>12 <em>Coinions</em>, divided into 6 tickets</s> 18 <em>Coiniions</em>, divided into 9 tickets. So, feel free to spend them as you prefer, probably visiting the different bars associated with this initiative. You can spend them any time of the day, any day during the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following map shows the bars accepting <Em>Coinions</em>. You can also <a href="/ye2015/img/YAPCEUROPE2015-Menus_08311205.pdf">download a PDF document containing all the information about bars, their locations, and also the tapas any of them offers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Very important!</strong> In every bar, only 2 different tapas can be asked per table at the same time. 
        Thus, if you visit a bar in group, everyone can ask for him/her tapa with the first drink,
        but you have to reach an agreement since no more than 2 different tapas can be asked. 
        Them, for the second drink, you can newly ask for a new tapa but, once more, take into account that no more than 2 different tapas per table can be asked. The same for your 3rd, 4th... drink.
